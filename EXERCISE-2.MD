TEST-STRATEGY

Test Strategy for REST API Automation: Petstore API
This test strategy focuses on the API testing for the Petstore Swagger API. The objective is to validate the functionality, performance, and reliability of the API by automating test cases for creating, modifying, and deleting data. The strategy will also cover testing for different HTTP status codes, edge cases, and invalid inputs.

1. Objective
The objective is to automate test cases for the Petstore API to ensure that all endpoints perform as expected for creating, updating, retrieving, and deleting pet records. The tests will cover happy path scenarios, edge cases, and error-handling mechanisms.

2. Scope of Testing
The following API operations will be tested:

POST: Create a new pet.
GET: Retrieve pet details.
PUT: Update an existing pet.
DELETE: Delete a pet by ID.
Validation of status codes (200, 201, 400, 404, 500).
Input validation (valid, invalid, incorrect formats).
Security and data integrity.
3. Test Levels
Functional Testing:

Validate that the API works correctly for all CRUD operations (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete).
Verify input validation for required and optional fields.
Ensure proper response codes for valid and invalid data.
Negative Testing:

Test for invalid requests, incorrect formats, missing fields, and unauthorized access.
Ensure appropriate error messages are returned for each failure scenario.
Regression Testing:

Automate test suites to ensure that changes to the API do not break existing functionality.
Performance Testing:

Test the API under different loads and measure response times.
Security Testing:

Validate authorization and authentication mechanisms (if applicable).
Test for common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, broken authentication, and data exposure.
4. Test Automation Framework
Tools:

Programming Language: Python
Testing Framework: PyTest
Libraries: Requests (for API calls), JSON, and logging.
Continuous Integration: Jenkins for automated test execution.
Version Control: GitHub for managing codebase and test scripts.
Reporting: Allure or HTML reports for test execution results.

TEST-PLANS

5. Test Plan
A. POST: Create a New Pet
Objective: Verify that a new pet can be created using the POST API endpoint.

Test Scenarios:
Create a new pet with valid data.
Attempt to create a pet with missing required fields (e.g., missing name or status).
Create a pet with invalid data (e.g., incorrect id format, invalid characters in name).
Ensure the API returns 201 Created for successful requests.
Validate that invalid requests return 400 Bad Request or other appropriate status codes.
Test boundary conditions (e.g., max length for pet name, special characters).



Test Data:

Valid Pet:
json
Copy code
{
  "id": 123456,
  "name": "Fluffy",
  "status": "available"
}
Invalid Pet:
json
Copy code
{
  "id": "abc123",
  "name": ""
}
Priority: High

B. GET: Retrieve Pet by ID
Objective: Verify that a pet's details can be retrieved using its ID.

Test Scenarios:
Retrieve pet details with a valid ID.
Attempt to retrieve a pet with an invalid ID (e.g., pet does not exist).
Test retrieving a pet with missing or incorrect ID format.
Ensure a valid response returns status code 200 OK.
Validate that 404 Not Found is returned for a pet that doesn't exist.
Verify response time and structure of the returned data.
Test Data:

Valid ID: 123456
Invalid ID: -9999 or a non-existent pet ID
Priority: High

C. PUT: Update an Existing Pet
Objective: Verify that an existing petâ€™s information can be updated using the PUT endpoint.

Test Scenarios:
Update an existing pet with valid data.
Attempt to update a pet with invalid data (e.g., invalid status, incorrect id format).
Update a non-existent pet and verify the response.
Validate that a successful update returns 200 OK.
Test edge cases such as updating with missing fields.
Test Data:

Valid Update:
json
Copy code
{
  "id": 123456,
  "name": "Fluffy",
  "status": "sold"
}
Priority: Medium

D. DELETE: Delete a Pet by ID
Objective: Ensure that pets can be deleted by their ID using the DELETE endpoint.

Test Scenarios:
Delete an existing pet and validate the response.
Attempt to delete a non-existent pet and verify the 404 Not Found response.
Test deleting a pet with an invalid or incorrect ID format.
Ensure the API returns 200 OK or 204 No Content for successful deletion.
Validate that a pet cannot be retrieved after deletion.
Test Data:

Valid ID for deletion: 123456
Invalid ID for deletion: -9999 or non-existent ID
Priority: High

E. Input Validation and Error Handling
Objective: Test various input validation and error-handling scenarios.

Test Scenarios:
Send an API request with missing required fields and ensure proper error messages.
Use incorrect data types for fields (e.g., string for id instead of integer).
Test invalid HTTP methods on each endpoint (e.g., using POST where PUT is expected).
Validate response for unauthorized access if applicable.
Test Data:

Invalid Data: Invalid types, missing fields, extra fields
Priority: Medium

6. Test Environment
API Endpoint: https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/
Test Data: Predefined and dynamically generated pet data.
Environment Setup: Local development environment for running tests, CI/CD pipeline for automated execution.
Test Execution: Automate test execution using Jenkins with scheduled runs on code commits.
7. Test Execution and Automation
Manual Testing:

Functional testing of all critical APIs (happy paths and edge cases).
Automated Testing:

Automate all CRUD operations (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) with positive and negative scenarios using PyTest and Requests.
Schedule automated regression runs on Jenkins with test reports.
8. Entry and Exit Criteria
Entry Criteria:

API endpoints must be functional and accessible.
Test data is prepared and environments are set up.
Exit Criteria:

All test cases have been executed with 95% pass rate.
No high-priority defects remain unresolved.
9. Risk Analysis
Invalid data handling could lead to errors in production.
Performance issues under load could affect user experience.
Security vulnerabilities might expose sensitive data.
Mitigation: Focus on thorough negative testing, edge case validation, and early performance tests.
